# Security Guide for Vibe LMS

## Authentication & Authorization

### Session Management
- JWT-based authentication with secure token generation
- Session tokens stored in HTTP-Only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
- Anonymous session support for public course access
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms implemented
- Session invalidation on logout

### Password Security
- Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds for password storage
- Password strength requirements enforced on frontend
- No plain text password storage anywhere in the system
- Secure password reset functionality (when implemented)

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Multi-tier user roles: `admin`, `instructor`, `student`
- Route-level authorization middleware
- API endpoint protection based on user roles
- Resource-level permissions for course and lesson access

## Database Security

### Connection Security
- PostgreSQL connection with parameterized queries
- Drizzle ORM prevents SQL injection attacks
- Database connection pooling for efficient resource management
- Environment-based database configuration

### Data Protection
- Input validation using Zod schemas on all API endpoints
- Sanitized file uploads with type and size restrictions
- Proper database indexing for performance without exposing sensitive data
- Foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity

## API Security

### Input Validation
- Request body validation using Drizzle-Zod schemas
- File upload restrictions (type, size, location)
- Filename sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks
- Query parameter validation and sanitization

### Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- Implement rate limiting middleware (recommended for production)
- Request size limits configured
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

### CORS Configuration
- Properly configured CORS headers
- Environment-specific origin restrictions
- Preflight request handling

## File Upload Security

### Upload Restrictions
- File type validation using MIME type checking
- File size limits enforced (configurable per file type)
- Sanitized filename generation to prevent malicious names
- Upload directory restrictions and path validation

### Storage Security
- Files stored outside web-accessible directories
- No execution permissions on upload directories
- Virus scanning recommended for production environments
- Regular cleanup of temporary and unused files

## Frontend Security

### XSS Prevention
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers recommended
- React's built-in XSS protection through JSX escaping
- Markdown sanitization in rich text editor
- User-generated content properly escaped

### CSRF Protection
- SameSite cookie attributes configured
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations (recommended)
- Double-submit cookie pattern for additional protection

## Production Security

### Environment Configuration
- Secure environment variable management
- Database SSL connections in production
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- Secure cookie settings (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)

### Monitoring & Logging
- Request logging without sensitive data exposure
- Error logging with appropriate detail levels
- Authentication attempt monitoring
- Failed login attempt tracking

### Infrastructure Security
- Regular security updates for all dependencies
- Container security scanning (when using Docker)
- Database backup encryption
- Network segmentation and firewall rules

## Data Privacy

### User Data Protection
- Minimal data collection principles
- User consent mechanisms for data processing
- Data retention policies and cleanup procedures
- Proper user data deletion on account removal

### GDPR Compliance (if applicable)
- User data export functionality
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Data processing consent tracking
- Privacy policy and terms of service integration

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Secure coding practices and code reviews
- Static application security testing (SAST)
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST)

### Deployment
- Secrets management (use environment variables)
- SSL/TLS certificate management
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Incident response procedures

### Maintenance
- Regular backup testing and restoration procedures
- Security patch management
- User access reviews and cleanup
- Audit log retention and analysis

## Security Checklist

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Enable HTTPS and redirect HTTP traffic
- [ ] Configure secure database connections with SSL
- [ ] Set secure cookie attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and request size limits
- [ ] Configure proper CORS policies
- [ ] Enable Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for security events
- [ ] Conduct security testing and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Review and update all default credentials
- [ ] Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Regular Security Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review user access permissions quarterly
- [ ] Conduct security audits annually
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activities
- [ ] Review and update security policies

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures
1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts for suspicious activities
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and severity of the incident
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent spread
4. **Investigation**: Analyze the incident to understand the cause
5. **Recovery**: Restore services and implement fixes
6. **Post-Incident**: Document lessons learned and improve security

### Contact Information
- Maintain updated contact information for security team
- Establish communication channels for incident reporting
- Define escalation procedures for different severity levels
